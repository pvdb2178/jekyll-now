title: Building Data Science Teams That Get Results
---

Last week Emily Wiegand and I hosted a discussion session with the topic "Building Data Science Teams That Get Results" at the [Data Science for Social Good Conference](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/data-science-for-social-good-conference/). Below are some of the key insights that came out of the session:

- **Maintaining team diversity is important**. Participants particularly highlighted diversity in terms of demographics of team members as well as character types and the skillsets team members possess -- which in an ideal case should include some of each of the key types of skills the team will need, for example: working with databases, machine learning, statistics, mathematics, computer science, visualization, content expertise, etc. Research agrees that diverse teams perform better than homogenous teams, which is true in the data science context too. 

- **As a data science community we need to think about the tools that we're using to do our work.** In particular participants noted:
  1. data science teams need to make sure they adopt the collaboration tools software developers have been using for years, to ensure versioning, debugging, testing, etc. 
  2. the tools we use to do data science will differ over the course of the project. For example, during the exploratory phase of the work we're more likely to use (local?) notebooks such as Jupyter Notebooks which lends itself to hacking things together to extract the data stories, test the code, etc. However, in later stages teams will run their code on remote machines, and shift to Github (and maybe even use versioning?) to build models, create insights, and eventually visualize and communicate the work

- **We need to think more broadly about _who_ we think of as the team.** While the core team may be composed of the data scientists, we cannot exclude the people that will help us understand the data (data owners) or the end-user and the partners we work with to implement our work. If do exclude them and work in isolation, we risk creating products or insights that aren't useful and won't have any impact. In other words, if we want to build a data science team that gets results we need to consider end-users and data owners as part of our team

- **The job market for data scientist is still immature** which means employers and employees need to be specific about what they want to work on and set the right expectation. Furthermore, employers don't know how to recruit for data scientist and will often create job postings that will look something like "We're looking for a data scientist. Skills required: Excel and Visual Basic". If you're trying to recruit data scientists for your team, **it is much easier to describe the actual tasks and objectives that you'd like the person to work on**. That way the potential job candidates can make their own judgement of whether are capable of doing the job, as opposed to making it a tool-specific requestAlso, be cautious about the timelines, given that these can be highly uncertain in those cases where data still needs to be collected, analyzed, etc. 

- **Data scientists requiere a healthy sense of humility and a bias-for-action**. Members of a data science team function much better going in with the attitude "I'm not an expert but will learn what it takes to get this done together with the rest of my team". Some participants noted that they had burned their fingers in the past, relying on the wrong signals while selecting team members (such as  only scanning for Ivy-league graduates, not checking for a candidates ability to work in dynamic team environment, having hands-on experience, or being comfortable with having to self-educate, etc.). Furthermore, it is key to not hold on too a specific identity, such as "I'm a [insert: statistician, economist, machine-learning expert, computer scientist, etc.] and therefore I don't do [insert: .. work with databases, .. do visualiztion, .. don't work with Python, .. don't do statistics, .. etc]". Holding on too much to a specific identity to stay in one's comfort zone make it hard to have a performing data science team.  

- **Data science skills are not binary**. Instead of saying "I know [insert: Python, SQL, etc.]" we should look at the team members and say "this team member is a beginner/intermediate/expert in [insert: Python, SQL, etc.]"	This especially needs to be looked at in light of the task at hand. One might know enough Python to explore a basic dataset with some crosstabs in an Jupyter notebook, but not enough Python to create an automatic reproducible and reliable pipeline which runs in a resource-efficient way. 

Other interesting and important questions that were raised but we didn't have time to answer:

- What is the difference between a data science team that does something for the first time vs. a data science team that needs to make some thing reproducible and of production-ready quality?

- Where is the boundary between IT and the Data Science team?

- What different data science roles exist out there?

- Where in an organisation should a data science team sit and how does this affect its performance? 

Many thanks to all participants in the session for sharing their insights!!
