title: Building Data Science Teams That Get Results
---

Last Emily Wiegand and I hosted a discussion session with the topic "Building Data Science Teams That Get Results" at the [Data Science for Social Good Conference](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/data-science-for-social-good-conference/). Below are some of the key insights that came out of the session:

- Data scientist requiere a healthy sense of humility

- As a data science community we need to think about the tools that we're using to do our work. In particular:
  1. data science teams need to make sure they adopt the collaboration tools software developers have been using
  2. the tools we use to do data science will differ over the course of the project. For example, during the exploratory phase of the work we're more likely to use (local?) notebooks such as Jupyter Notebooks which lends itself to hacking things together to extract the data stories, test the code, etc. However, in later stages teams will run their code on remote machines, and shift to Github (and maybe even use versioning?) to build models, create insights, and eventually visualize and communicate the work

- Maintaining team diversity is important, both from a demographic as well as a skills point of view

- We need to think about 'who' the team is. While the core team may be composed of the data scientists, we cannot exclude the end-user and the partners we work with implement our work, and have the real impact

- The job market for data scientist is still immature, which means:
  - employers don't know how to recruit for data scientist and will often create job postings that will look something like "We're looking for a data scientist. Skills required: Excel and Visual Basic". If you're trying to recruit data scientists, it is much easier to

Other interesting and important questions that were raised but we didn't get time to answer
- What is the difference between a data science team that does something for the first time vs. a data science team that needs to make some thing reproducible and of production-ready quality?
